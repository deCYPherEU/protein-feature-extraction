# Peptide Features Component

This component is responsible for extracting features from a protein sequence that uses the `peptides` package. These features
include physicochemical properties of amino acids (hydrophobicity, aliphaticity, ...) and amino acid fractions and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the peptide sequence.

## Env Setup

No environment variables are needed for this component.
