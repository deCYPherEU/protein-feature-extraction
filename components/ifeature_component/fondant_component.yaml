image: iFeature_component:latest

consumes:
  sequence:
        type: string

produces:
  additionalProperties: true
  # impossible to define the output schema as it is dependent on the input. There can be different features generated for different sequences.
  # the sequence will be known, but for some reason Fondant is too quick. This when the sequence is not yet available, which breaks the pipeline
  # So, I'll just add the additionalProperties: true so that the pipeline runs at least.
